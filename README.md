# Machine-Learning-by-Python-realization # Bank Customer Churn Prediction
I did this machine learning project via python programming and the data used here were extracted from Kaggle dataset.

The customer churn, which is also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon whereby a customer leaves a company. Some studies confirmed that acquiring new customers can cost five times more than satisfying and retaining existing customers. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of benefits that encourage the tracking of the customer churn rate, for example:

1. Marketing costs to acquire new customers are high. Therefore, it is important to retain customers so that the initial investment is not wasted;
2. It has a direct impact on the ability to expand the company;
etc.

In this project I build a prediction model that will perform the following:

1. Classify if a customer is going to churn or not
2. Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn
